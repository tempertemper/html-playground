title: Accordions
intro: HTML gives us the ability to show and hide content using native elements.
---

The elements we use for this are `<details>` and `<summary>`:

<details>
    <summary>Reveal more content</summary>
    <p>This is the contents that are revealed when the {{ "<summary>" | escape }} element is activated.</p>
</details>
